<h1>Comma Separated Value (.csv)</h1>

OGR supports reading and writing non-spatial tabular data stored in
text CSV files.  CSV files are a common interchange format between 
software packages supporting tabular data and are also easily produced
manually with a text editor or with end-user written scripts or programs.<p>

While in theory .csv files could have any extension, in order to
auto-recognise the format OGR only supports CSV files ending with the
extention ".csv".  The datasource name may be either a single CSV file
or to a directory.  For a directory to be recognised as a .csv datasource
at least half the files in the directory need to have the extension .csv.
One layer (table) is produced from each .csv file accessed.<p>

The OGR CSV driver supports reading and writing.  Because the CSV format 
has variable length text lines, reading is done sequentially.  Reading 
features in random order will generally be very slow.  OGR CSV layer never
have any geometry on features, nor do they have an associated coordinate
system.  The OGR CSV driver returns all attribute columns with a  type of
string if no field type information file (with .csvt extension) is
available.<p>

Limited type recognition can be done for Integer, Real and String
columns through a descriptive file with same name as the CSV file,
but .csvt extension. In a single line the types for each column
have to be listed: double quoted and comma
separated (e.g., "Integer","String"). The driver will then use these types
as specified for the csv columns.<p>

<h2>Format</h2>

CSV files have one line for each feature (record) in the layer (table).  
The attribute field values are separated by commas.  At least two fields
per line must be present.  Lines may be terminated by a DOS (CR/LF) or
Unix (LF) style line terminators.  Each record should have the same number
of fields.<p>

Complex attribute values (such as those containing commas, quotes or newlines) 
may be placed in double quotes.  Any occurances of double quotes within 
the quoted string should be doubled up to "escape" them.<p>

The driver attempts to treat the first line of the file as a list of field 
names for all the fields.  However, if one or more of the names is all 
numeric it is assumed that the first line is actually data values and
dummy field names are generated internally (field_1 through field_n) and
the first record is treated as a feature. <p>

Example (employee.csv):
<pre>
ID,Salary,Name,Comments
132,55000.0,John Walker,"The ""big"" cheese."
133,11000.0,Jane Lake,Cleaning Staff
</pre>

Note that the Comments value for the first data record is placed in 
double quotes because the value contains quotes, and those quotes have
to be doubled up so we know we haven't reached the end of the quoted string
yet. <p>

Many variations of textual input are sometimes called Comma Separated
Value files, including files without commas, but fixed column widths,
those using tabs as seperators or those with other auxilary data defining
field types or structure.  This driver does not attempt to support all 
such files, but instead to support simple .csv files that can be 
auto-recognised.  Scripts or other mechanisms can generally be used to convert
other variations into a form that is compatible with the OGR CSV driver. <p>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

The driver supports creating new databases (as a directory
of .csv files), adding new .csv files to an existing directory or .csv
files or appending features to an existing .csv table.  Deleting or
replacing existing features is not supported.<p>

Creation options:

<ul>

<li> <b>LINEFORMAT</b>:
By default when creating new .csv files they are created with the line
termination conventions of the local platform (CR/LF on win32 or 
LF on all other systems).  This may be overridden through use of the
LINEFORMAT layer creation option which may have a value of <b>CRLF</b>
(DOS format) or <b>LF</b> (Unix format). <p>

</ul>
