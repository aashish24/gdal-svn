<h1>WFS - OGC WFS service</h1>

(GDAL/OGR >= 1.8.0)<p>

This driver can connect to a OGC WFS service. It supports WFS 1.0.0 and WFS 1.1.0 protocols. GDAL/OGR must be built with Curl support in order to the
WFS driver to be compiled. Usually WFS requests return results in GML format, so the GML driver should generally be set-up for read support
(thus requiring GDAL/OGR to be built with Xerces or Expat support). It is sometimes possible to use alternate underlying formats when the server supports them
(such as OUTPUTFORMAT=json).<p>

The driver supports read-only services, as well as Transactionnal ones (WFS-T).<p>

The minimal syntax to open a WFS datasource is : <i>WFS:http://path/to/WFS/service</i> or <i>http://path/to/WFS/service?SERVICE=WFS</i><p>

Additionnal optional parameters can be specified such as <i>TYPENAME</i>, <i>VERSION</i>, <i>MAXFEATURES</i> as specified in WFS specification.<p>

The driver will forward any spatial filter set with SetSpatialFilter() to the server. It also makes its best effort to do the same for attribute
filters set with SetAttributeFilter() when possible (turning OGR SQL language into OGC filter description). When this is not possible,
it will default to client-side only filtering, which can be a slow operation because involving fetching all the features from the servers.<p>

Note about performance : When reading the first feature from a layer, the whole layer content will be fetched from the server.<p>

<h2>Write support / WFS-T</h2>

The WFS-T protocol only eanbles the user to operate at feature level. No datasource, layer or field creations are possible.<p>

Write support is only enabled when the datasource is opened in update mode.<p>

The mapping between the operations of the WFS Transaction service and the OGR concepts is the following :
<ul>
<li>OGRFeature::CreateFeature() &lt;==&gt; WFS insert operation</li>
<li>OGRFeature::SetFeature() &lt;==&gt; WFS update operation</li>
<li>OGRFeature::DeleteFeature() &lt;==&gt; WFS delete operation</li>
</ul>

Lock operations (LockFeature service) are not available at that time.<p>

There are a few caveouts to keep in mind. OGR feature ID (FID) is an integer based value, whereas WFS/GML
gml:id attribute is a string. Thus it is not always possible to match both values. The WFS driver exposes
then the gml:id attribute of a feature as a 'gml_id' field.<p>

When inserting a new feature with CreateFeature(), and if the command is successfull, OGR will fetch the
returned gml:id and set the 'gml_id' field of the feature accordingly. It will also try to set the OGR FID
if the gml:id is of the form layer_name.numeric_value. Otherwise the FID will be left to its unset default value.<p>

When updating an existing feature with SetFeature(), the OGR FID field will be ignored. The request issued
to the driver will only take into account the value of the gml:id field of the feature. The same applies for
DeleteFeature().<p>

<h2>Write support and OGR transactions</h2>

The above operations are by default issued to the server synchronously with the OGR API call. This however
can cause performance penalties when issuing a lot of commands due to many client/server exchanges.<p>

It is possible to surround those operations between OGRLayer::StartTransaction() and OGRLayer::CommitTransaction().
The operations will be stored into memory and only executed at the time CommitTransaction() is called.<p>

The drawback for CreateFeature() is that the user cannot know which gml:id have been assigned to the inserted
features. A special SQL statement has been introduced into the WFS driver to workaround this : by issuing
the "SELECT _LAST_INSERTED_FIDS_ FROM layer_name" (where layer_name is to be replaced with the actual layer_name)
command through the OGRDataSource::ExecuteSQL(), a layer will be returned with as many rows
with a single attribue gml_id as the count of inserted features during the last commited transaction.<p>

Note : currently, only CreateFeature() makes use of OGR transaction mechanism. SetFeature() and DeleteFeature()
will still be issued immediately.

<h2>Special SQL commands</h2>

The following SQL / pseudo-SQL commands passed to OGRDataSource::ExecuteSQL() are specific of the WFS driver :<p>

<ul>

<li><p>"DELETE FROM layer_name WHERE expression" : this will result into
a WFS delete operation. This can be a fast way of deleting one or several features. In particularly, this
can be a faster replacement for OGRLayer::DeleteFeature() when the gml:id is known, but the feature has not
been fetched from the server.</p></li>

<li><p>"SELECT _LAST_INSERTED_FIDS_ FROM layer_name" : see above paragraph.</p></li>

</ul>

Currently, any other SQL command will be processed by the generic layer, meaning client-side only processing.
Server side spatial and attribute filtering must be done through the SetSpatialFilter() and SetAttributeFilter()
interfaces.<p>

</pre>

<li>
Retrieving the features of gml:id "world.2" and "world.3" from the tows:world layer :
<pre>
