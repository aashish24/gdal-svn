<h1>RasterLite2 - Rasters in SQLite DB</h1>

<p>Starting with GDAL 2.2, the SQLite driver allows reading SQLite databases
containing RasterLite2 coverages.</p>
<p>
  Those databases can be produced by the utilities of the
  <a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libRasterLite2/home">RasterLite2</a> distribution,
  such as rl2tools.<br>
  The driver supports reading grayscale, paletted, RGB, multispectral images stored as tiles in the many compressed formats supported by libRasterLite2.
  The driver also supports reading overviews/pyramids, spatial reference system and spatial extent.
</p>

<p>GDAL/OGR must be compiled with sqlite support and against librasterlite2 and libspatialite.</p>

<p>The driver is implemented a unified SQLite / SpatiaLite / RasterLite2
vector and raster capable driver./p>

<h2>Opening syntax</h2>

<p>A RasterLite2 filename can be specified as the connection string. If the
file contains a single RasterLite2 coverage, this one will be exposed as the
GDAL dataset. If the file contains multiple coverages, each one will be exposed
as a subdataset with the syntax RASTERLITE2:filename:coverage_name. See
<a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/librasterlite2/wiki?name=basic_concepts">the
basic concepts of RasterLite2</a>.</p>

<p>If a coverage is made of several sections, they will be listed as subdatasets
of the coverage dataset, so as to be accessed individually. By default, they
will be exposed as a unified dataset. The syntax of section-based dataset is
RASTERLITE2:filename:coverage_name:section_id:section_name.</p>
