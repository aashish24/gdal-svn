<h1>SQLite RDBMS</h1>

OGR optionally supports spatial and non-spatial tables stored in SQLite 3.x
database files.  SQLite is a "light weight" single file based RDBMS engine
with fairly complete SQL semantics and respectible performance. <p>

Each table is treated as a layer.  Layers with a WKT_GEOMETRY
field will be treated as spatial tables, and the WKT_GEOMETRY column will be
read as Well Known Text geometry. <p>

Currently the SQLite driver has no support for coordinate systems.<p>

The SQLite database is essentially typeless, but the SQLite driver will
attempt to classify attributes field as text, integer or floating point
based on the contents of the first record in a table.  None of the list
attribute field types existing in SQLite. <p>

SQLite databases often due not work well over NFS, or some other networked
file system protocols due to the poor support for locking.  It is safest
to operate only on SQLite files on a physical disk of the local system.<p>

SQLite is an optionally compiled in driver.  It is not compiled in by default.
<p>

While the SQLite driver supports reading spatial data from records, there is
not support for spatial indexing, so spatial queries will tend to be slow.
Attributes queries may be fast, especially if indexes are built for 
appropriate attribute columns using the "CREATE INDEX <indexname> 
ON <tablename> ( <columnname> )" SQL command.<p>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

The SQLite driver supports creating new SQLite database files, or adding
tables to existing ones.  Note that a new database file cannot be
created over an existing file. <p>
