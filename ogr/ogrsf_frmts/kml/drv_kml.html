<h1>KML - Keyhole Markup Language</h1>

<p>OGR has limited support for KML writing and no support
for reading KML. OGR generates KML 2.0. 
The KML driver has no coordinate system support at this time.<p>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>
<p>KML is mix of formatting and feature data. When writing KML, attributes are added to
the output with the following HTML structure:
<pre><b>Attribute name</b>: Attribute content</pre>
</p>
<p>The OGR KML driver supports multiple layers of data.  
Each input layer is translated into a separate KML "Folder" element.</p>
<h2>Creation Options</h2>
<p>The following creation options are supported:
<ul>
<li><b>NameField</b>: Allows you to specify the field to use for the KML &lt;name&gt; element. Default value : 'Name'</li>
<li><b>DescriptionField</b>: Allows you to specify the field to use for the KML &lt;name&gt; element. Default value : 'Description'</li>
<pre>ogr2ogr -f KML output.kml input.shp -dsco NameField=RegionName</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
The ogr2ogr utility can be used to dump the results of a PostGIS query to
KML:

<pre>
ogr2ogr -f KML output.kml PG:'host=myserver dbname=warmerda' -sql "SELECT pop_1994 from canada where province_name = 'Alberta'"
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>
The Google Earth seems to have some limits regarding the number of coordinates in complex geometries like polygons.
If the problem appears, then problematic geometries are displayed completely or partially covered by vertical stripes.
Unfortunately, there are no exact number given in the KML specification about this limitation, so the KML driver
will not warn about potential problems. One of possible and tested solutions is to simplify a line or a polygon to remove
some coordinates.
Here is the whole discussion about this issue on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/kml-support">Google KML Developer Forum</a>, in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/kml-support-getting-started/browse_thread/thread/e6995b8073e69c41">polygon displays with vertical stripes</a> thread.
