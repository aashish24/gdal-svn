<h1>GML - Geography Markup Language</h1>

OGR has limited support for GML reading and writing. Update of existing
files is not currently supported. OGR is based on GML 2.0. The reading only
works if OGR is built with Xerces linked in. Starting with GDAL 1.7.0, when
Xerces is unavailable, read support also works if OGR is built with Expat linked in.
XML validation is disabled by default.
GML writing is always supported, even without Xerces or Expat.<p>

The GML driver has no coordinate system support at this time.<p>

In contrast to most GML readers, the OGR GML reader makes no effort to read
the format XML Schema definition of the feature classes in a GML file.
Instead it attempts to automatically discover them and their associated
properties by scanning the file and looking for "known" gml objects in the
gml namespace to determine the organization.  While this approach is error
prone, it has the advantage of working for GML files even if the associated
schema (.xsd) file has been lost.<p>

The first time a GML file is opened it is completely scanned in order to
determine the set of featuretypes, the attributes associated with each and
other dataset level information.  This information is stored in a .gfs file
with the same basename as the target gml file.  Subsequent accesses to the
same GML file will use the .gfs file to predefine dataset level information
accelerating access.  To a limited extent the .gfs file can be manually edited
to alter how the GML file will be parsed.  Be warned that the .gfs file will
be automatically regenerated if the associated .gml file has a newer timestamp.
<p>

When prescanning the GML file to determine the list of feature types, and
fields, the contents of fields are scanned to try and determine the type
of the field.  In some applications it is easier if all fields are just treated
as string fields.  This can be accomplished by setting the configuration
option <b>GML_FIELDTYPES</b> to the value <b>ALWAYS_STRING</b>.  Configuration
options can be set via the CPLSetConfigOption() function or as environment
variables.<p>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

On export all layers are written to a single GML file all in a single
feature collection.  Each layer's name is used as the element name for
objects from that layer.  Geometries are always written as the 
ogr:geometryProperty property on the feature.<p>

The GML writer supports the following creation options:

<ul>
<li> <B>XSISCHEMAURI</B>: If provided, this URI will be inserted as the
schema location.  Note that the schema file isn't actually accessed by OGR, so
it is up to the user to ensure it will match the schema of the OGR produced 
GML data file.<p>

<li> <B>XSISCHEMA</B>: This can be EXTERNAL, INTERNAL or OFF and defaults to
EXTERNAL.  This (attempts) to write a BXML compatible GML schema file to
a corresponding .xsd file (with the same basename).  The generated schema is
still experimental. If INTERNAL is used the schema is written within the GML
file, but this is even more experimental and almost certainly not valid XML.
OFF disables schema generation (and is implicit if XSISCHEMAURI is used). 
<p>

</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>

The ogr2ogr utility can be used to dump the results of a Oracle query to
GML:

<pre>
ogr2ogr -f GML output.gml OCI:usr/pwd@db my_feature -where "id = 0"
</pre>

<P>
The ogr2ogr utility can be used to dump the results of a PostGIS query to
GML:

<pre>
ogr2ogr -f GML output.gml PG:'host=myserver dbname=warmerda' -sql "SELECT pop_1994 from canada where province_name = 'Alberta'"

</pre>
