<h1>GML - Geography Markup Language</h1>

OGR has limited support for GML reading and writing. Update of existing
files is not currently supported. OGR is based on GML 2.0. The reading only
works if OGR is built with Xerces linked in. Starting with GDAL 1.7.0, when
Xerces is unavailable, read support also works if OGR is built with Expat linked in.
XML validation is disabled by default.
GML writing is always supported, even without Xerces or Expat.<p>

The GML driver has no coordinate system support at this time.<p>

In contrast to most GML readers, the OGR GML reader makes no effort to read
the format XML Schema definition of the feature classes in a GML file.
Instead it attempts to automatically discover them and their associated
properties by scanning the file and looking for "known" gml objects in the
gml namespace to determine the organization.  While this approach is error
prone, it has the advantage of working for GML files even if the associated
schema (.xsd) file has been lost.<p>

The first time a GML file is opened it is completely scanned in order to
determine the set of featuretypes, the attributes associated with each and
other dataset level information.  This information is stored in a .gfs file
with the same basename as the target gml file.  Subsequent accesses to the
same GML file will use the .gfs file to predefine dataset level information
accelerating access.  To a limited extent the .gfs file can be manually edited
to alter how the GML file will be parsed.  Be warned that the .gfs file will
be ignored if the associated .gml file has a newer timestamp.
<p>

When prescanning the GML file to determine the list of feature types, and
fields, the contents of fields are scanned to try and determine the type of the
field.  In some applications it is easier if all fields are just treated as
string fields.  This can be accomplished by setting the configuration option
<b>GML_FIELDTYPES</b> to the value <b>ALWAYS_STRING</b>.<p>

OGR 1.8.0 adds support for detecting feature attributes in nested GML elements
(non-flat attribute hierarchy) that can be found in some GML profiles
such as UK Ordnance Survey MasterMap. OGR 1.8.0 also brings support for reading
IntegerList, RealList and StringList field types when a GML element has several occurences.<p>

Since OGR 1.8.0, a specialized GML driver - the NAS driver - is available to read
German AAA GML Exchange Format (NAS).<p>

Configuration options can be set via the CPLSetConfigOption() function or as
environment variables.<p>

OGR 1.8.0 adds support for more GML geometries including TopoCurve,
TopoSurface, MultiCurve. The TopoCurve type GML geometry can be interpreted as
either of two types of geometries.  The Edge elements in it contain curves and
their corresponding nodes.  By default only the curves, the main geometries,
are reported as OGRMultiLineString.  To retrieve the nodes, as OGRMultiPoint,
the configuration option <b>GML_GET_SECONDARY_GEOM</b> should be set to the
value <b>YES</b>.  When this is set only the secondary geometries are
reported.<p>

OGR 1.8.0 adds support for gml:xlink resolving.  When the resolver finds an
element containing the tag xlink:href, it tries to find the corresponding
element with the gml:id in the same gml file, other gml file in the file system
or on the web using cURL.  Set the configuration option
<b>GML_SKIP_RESOLVE_ELEMS</b> to <b>NONE</b> to enable resolution.<p>

By default the resolved file will be saved in the
same directory as the original file with the extension ".resolved.gml", if it
doesn't exist already.  This behaviour can be changed using the configuration
option <b>GML_SAVE_RESOLVED_TO</b>.  Set it to <b>SAME</b> to overwrite the
original file.  Set it to a <b>filename ending with .gml</b> to save it to that
location.  Any other values are ignored.  If the resolver cannot write to the
file for any reason, it will try to save it to a temperary file generated using
CPLGenerateTempFilename("ResolvedGML"); if it cannot, resolution fails.<p>

Note that the resolution algorithm is not optimised for large files.  For files
with more than a couple of thousand xlink:href tags, the process can go beyond
a few minutes.  A rough progress is displayed through CPLDebug() for every
256 links.  It can be seen by setting the environment variable CPL_DEBUG.
The resolution time can be reduced if you know any elements that
won't be needed.  Mention a comma seperated list of names of such elements with
the configuration option <b>GML_SKIP_RESOLVE_ELEMS</b>.  Set it to <b>ALL</b>
to skip resolving altogether (default action).  Set it to <b>NONE</b> to
resolve all the xlinks.<p>

<h2>Encoding issues</h2>

Expat library supports reading the following built-in encodings :
<ul>
<li>US-ASCII</li>
<li>UTF-8</li>
<li>UTF-16</li>
<li>ISO-8859-1</li>
</ul>

When used with Expat library, OGR 1.8.0 adds supports for Windows-1252 encoding (
for previous versions, altering the encoding mentionned in the XML header to
ISO-8859-1 might work in some cases).<p>

The content returned by OGR will be encoded in UTF-8, after the conversion from the
encoding mentionned in the file header is.<p>

If your GML file is not encoded in one of the previous encodings, it will not be parsed by the
GML driver. You may convert it into one of the supported encoding with the <i>iconv</i> utility
for example and change accordingly the <i>encoding</i> parameter value in the XML header.<br>
<p>

When writing a GML file, the driver expects UTF-8 content to be passed in.<p>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

On export all layers are written to a single GML file all in a single
feature collection.  Each layer's name is used as the element name for
objects from that layer.  Geometries are always written as the 
ogr:geometryProperty property on the feature.<p>

The GML writer supports the following creation options:

<ul>
<li> <B>XSISCHEMAURI</B>: If provided, this URI will be inserted as the
schema location.  Note that the schema file isn't actually accessed by OGR, so
it is up to the user to ensure it will match the schema of the OGR produced 
GML data file.<p>

<li> <B>XSISCHEMA</B>: This can be EXTERNAL, INTERNAL or OFF and defaults to
EXTERNAL.  This (attempts) to write a BXML compatible GML schema file to
a corresponding .xsd file (with the same basename).  The generated schema is
still experimental. If INTERNAL is used the schema is written within the GML
file, but this is even more experimental and almost certainly not valid XML.
OFF disables schema generation (and is implicit if XSISCHEMAURI is used). 
<p>

</ul>

<h2>Syntax of .gfs file by example</h2>

Let's consider the following test.gml file :

<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;gml:FeatureCollection xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml"&gt;
  &lt;gml:featureMember&gt;
    &lt;LAYER&gt;
      &lt;attrib1&gt;attrib1_value&lt;/attrib1&gt;
      &lt;attrib2container&gt;
        &lt;attrib2&gt;attrib2_value&lt;/attrib2&gt;
      &lt;/attrib2container&gt;
      &lt;location1container&gt;
        &lt;location1&gt;
            &lt;gml:Point&gt;&lt;gml:coordinates&gt;3,50&lt;/gml:coordinates&gt;&lt;/gml:Point&gt;
        &lt;/location1&gt;
      &lt;/location1container&gt;
      &lt;location2&gt;
        &lt;gml:Point&gt;&lt;gml:coordinates&gt;2,49&lt;/gml:coordinates&gt;&lt;/gml:Point&gt;
      &lt;/location2&gt;
    &lt;/LAYER&gt;
  &lt;/gml:featureMember&gt;
&lt;/gml:FeatureCollection&gt;
</pre>

and the following associated .gfs file.

<pre>
&lt;GMLFeatureClassList&gt;
  &lt;GMLFeatureClass&gt;
    &lt;Name&gt;LAYER&lt;/Name&gt;
    &lt;ElementPath&gt;LAYER&lt;/ElementPath&gt;
    &lt;GeometryElementPath&gt;location1container|location1&lt;/GeometryElementPath&gt;
    &lt;PropertyDefn&gt;
      &lt;Name&gt;attrib1&lt;/Name&gt;
      &lt;ElementPath&gt;attrib1&lt;/ElementPath&gt;
      &lt;Type&gt;String&lt;/Type&gt;
      &lt;Width&gt;13&lt;/Width&gt;
    &lt;/PropertyDefn&gt;
    &lt;PropertyDefn&gt;
      &lt;Name&gt;attrib2&lt;/Name&gt;
      &lt;ElementPath&gt;attrib2container|attrib2&lt;/ElementPath&gt;
      &lt;Type&gt;String&lt;/Type&gt;
      &lt;Width&gt;13&lt;/Width&gt;
    &lt;/PropertyDefn&gt;
  &lt;/GMLFeatureClass&gt;
&lt;/GMLFeatureClassList&gt;
</pre>

Note the presence of the '|' character in the &lt;ElementPath&gt; and &lt;GeometryElementPath&gt elements to
specify the wished field/geometry element that is a nested XML element. Nested field elements are only supported from OGR 1.8.0, as well
 as specifying &lt;GeometryElementPath&gt; If GeometryElementPath is not specified, the
GML driver will use the last recognized geometry element.<p>

The output of <i>ogrinfo test.gml -ro -al</i> is:
<pre>
Layer name: LAYER
Geometry: Unknown (any)
Feature Count: 1
Extent: (3.000000, 50.000000) - (3.000000, 50.000000)
Layer SRS WKT:
(unknown)
Geometry Column = location1container|location1
attrib1: String (13.0)
attrib2: String (13.0)
OGRFeature(LAYER):0
  attrib1 (String) = attrib1_value
  attrib2 (String) = attrib2_value
  POINT (3 50)
</pre>

<h2>Example</h2>

The ogr2ogr utility can be used to dump the results of a Oracle query to
GML:

<pre>
ogr2ogr -f GML output.gml OCI:usr/pwd@db my_feature -where "id = 0"
</pre>

<P>
The ogr2ogr utility can be used to dump the results of a PostGIS query to
GML:

<pre>
ogr2ogr -f GML output.gml PG:'host=myserver dbname=warmerda' -sql "SELECT pop_1994 from canada where province_name = 'Alberta'"

</pre>
