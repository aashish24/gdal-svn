<h1>MapInfo TAB and MIF/MID</h1>

MapInfo datasets in native (TAB) format and in interchange (MIF/MID) format
are supported for reading and writing.  Update of existing files is not 
currently supported.<p>

Note: In the rest of this document "MIF/MID File" is used to refer to a
pair of .MIF + .MID files, and "TAB file" refers to the set of files for a 
MapInfo table in binary form (usually with extensions .TAB, .DAT, .MAP, .ID,
.IND).<p>

The MapInfo driver treats a whole directory of files as a dataset, and 
a single file within that directory as a layer.  In this case the directory
name should be used as the dataset name.  <p>

However, it is also possible to use one of the files (.tab or .mif) in a 
MapInfo set as the dataset name, and then it will be treated as a dataset 
with one single layer.<p>

MapInfo coordinate system information is supported for reading and writing.<p>


<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

The TAB File format requires that the bounds (geographical extents) of a new
file be set before writing the first feature.  However, there is currently
no clean mechanism to set the default bounds of a new file through the 
OGRDataSource interface. <P>

We should fix the driver at some point to set valid default bounds for 
each projection, but for the time being, the MapInfo driver sets the following
default bounds when a new layer is created:
<UL>
  <LI>For a file in LAT/LON (geographic) coordinates: BOUNDS (-180, -90) (180, 90)
  <LI>For any other projection: BOUNDS (-30000000, -15000000) (30000000, 15000000)
</UL>
<p>

If no coordinate system is provided when creating a layer, the projection
case is used, not geographic which can result in very low precision if
the coordinates really are geographic.  You can add "-a_srs WGS84" to the
<b>ogr2ogr</b> commandline during a translation to force geographic mode.<p>

MapInfo feature attributes suffer a number of limitations:<P>

<ul>
<li> Only Integer, Real and String field types can be created.  The various
list, and binary field types cannot be created.<p>

<li> For String fields, the field width is used to establish storage size in
the .dat file.  This means that strings longer than the field width will be
truncated.<p>

<li> String fields without an assigned width are treated as 254 characters.<p>

</ul>

To create MID/MIF instead of TAB files use the dataset creation option
"FORMAT=MIF". <p>
