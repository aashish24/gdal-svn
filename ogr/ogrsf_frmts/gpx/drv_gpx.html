<h1>GPX - GPS Exchange Format</h1>

GPX (the GPS Exchange Format) is a light-weight XML data format for the interchange of GPS data (waypoints, routes, and tracks) between applications and Web services on the Internet.<p>

OGR has support for GPX reading (if GDAL is build with <i>expat</i> library support) and writing.<p>

The OGR driver supports reading and writing of all the GPX feature types :
<ul>
<li>waypoints (layer of features of OGR type wkbPoint)</li>
<li>routes (layer of features of OGR type wkbLineString)</li>
<li>tracks (layer of features of OGR type wkbMultiLineString)</li>
</ul>

All coordinates are relative to the WGS84 datum (EPSG:4326).<p>

If the environment variable GPX_ELE_AS_25D is set to YES, the elevation element will
be used to set the Z coordinates of waypoints, route points and track points.<p>

The OGR/GPX reads and writes the GPX attributes for the waypoints, routes and tracks,
but not the attributes of route points and track points, as they cannot be
fit into the OGR Simple Feature model.<p>

<p> 

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

On export all layers are written to a single GPX file. Update of existing
files is not currently supported.<p>
If the output file already exits, the writing will not occur. You have to delete the existing file first.<p>

Supported geometries :
<ul>
<li>Features of type wkbPoint/wkbPoint25D are written in the waypoint element.</li>
<li>Features of type wkbLineString/wkbLineString25D are written in the route element.</li>
<li>Features of type wkbMultiLineString/wkbMultiLineString25D are written in the track element.</li>
<li>Other type of geometries are not supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>

For route points and tracks points, if there is a Z coordinate, it is used to fill the elevation element
of the corresponding points.<p>

The GPX writer supports the following creation options (layer options):
<ul>
<li> <b>FORCE_GPX_TRACK</b>:
By default when writting a layer whose features are of type wkbLineString, the GPX driver
chooses to write them as routes. If FORCE_GPX_TRACK=YES is specified, they will be written
as tracks.<p>
<li> <b>FORCE_GPX_ROUTE</b>:
By default when writting a layer whose features are of type wkbMultiLineString, the GPX driver
chooses to write them as tracks. If FORCE_GPX_ROUTE=YES is specified, they will be written
as routes, provided that the multilines are composed of only one single line.<p>
</ul>
<p>

Waypoints, routes and tracks must be written into that order to be valid against the XML Schema.


<h2>Example</h2>

The ogrinfo utility can be used to dump the content of a GPX datafile :

<pre>
ogrinfo -ro -al input.gpx
</pre>

<P>
The ogr2ogr utility can be used to do GPX to GPX translation :

<pre>
ogr2ogr -f GPX output.gpx input.gpx

</pre>
