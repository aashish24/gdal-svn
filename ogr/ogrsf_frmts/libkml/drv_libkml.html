    <h3>Enviroment Variables</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>LIBKML_USE_DOC.KML</dt>
        <dd>read/write a kml file with a network link to each layer file, for
         .kmz and dir datasets. Defaults to yes</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Style</h3>
    Style tables are wrote to the document in a .kml file, style/style.kml
    in a kmz file.
    <h3>Schema</h3>
    
    <h2>Layer</h2>
    
    <h3>Style</h3>
    Layer style tables cannot be read or written to a kml layer that is a folder,
    otherwise they are in the document that is the layer.
    
    <h3>Schema</h3>
    Read and write of Schema is supported for .kml files , .kmz files, and dirs.
    
    <h3>Other</h3>
    Description, timestamp, timespan, open, and Visibility are not supported on
    layers as there is no place in ogr to store this data.
