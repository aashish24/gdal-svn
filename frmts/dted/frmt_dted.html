<h1>DTED -- Military Elevation Data</h1>

GDAL supports DTED Levels 0, 1, and 2 elevation data for read access.  
Elevation data is returned as 16 bit signed integer.  Appropriate 
projection (always WGS84) and georeferencing information is also returned.   
A variety of header fields are returned dataset level metadata.
<p>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

The DTED driver does support creating new files, but the input data
must be exactly formatted as a Level 0, 1 or 2 cell.  That is the size,
and bounds must be appropriate for a cell.<P>
