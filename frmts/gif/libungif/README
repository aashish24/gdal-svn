This code is from libungif 4.1.0

In theory it comes from:
  http://prtr-13.ucsc.edu/~badger/software/libungif.shtml

But I don't think this works any more. I generally dig up 
source RPMs to dig up the code.  

Changes:
 o Select only lib files needed.
 o Fix a few warnings about unused variables. 
 o Hack private include file to avoid VersionString warnings.
 o Hacked in O_BINARY support whereever O_BINARY is defined.
