<h1>BLX -- Magellan BLX Topo File Format</h1>

<p>
BLX is the format for storing topographic data in Magellan GPS units. This driver
supports both reading and writing. In addition the 4 overview levels inherent in
the BLX format can be used with the driver. 
</p>

<p>
The data type is fixed to Int16 and the value for undefined values is fixed to -32768.
</p>

<h2>Georeferencing</h2>

<p>
The BLX projection is fixed to WGS84 and georeferencing from BLX is supported in the form of one tiepoint and 
pixelsize.
</p>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

Creation Options:
<p>

<ul>

<li> <b>ZSCALE=1</b>: Set the desired quantization increment for write access. A higher value will result in better compression and lower vertical resolution.
<li> <b>BIGENDIAN=YES</b>: If BIGENDIAN is defined, the output file will be in XLB format (big endian blx).

</ul>
