<h1>ERS -- ERMapper .ERS</h1>

GDAL supports reading and writing raster files with .ers header files, with some
limitations.  The .ers ascii format is used by ERMapper for labelling raw 
data files, as well as for providing extended metadata, and georeferencing 
for some other file formats.  The .ERS format, or variants are also used to
hold descriptions of ERMapper algorithms, but these are not supported by GDAL.
