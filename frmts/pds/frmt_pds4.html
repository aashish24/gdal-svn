<h1>PDS4 -- NASA Planetary Data System (Version 4)</h1>

PDS4 is a format used primarily by NASA to store and distribute
solar, lunar and planetary imagery data.  GDAL provides read-write
access to PDS4 formatted imagery data.<p>

PDS4 files are compose of a .xml (label) file which references a raw imagery
file. The driver also supports imagery stored in a separate uncompressed
GeoTIFF file with a strip organization compatible of a raw imagery file.<p>

The driver also reads and write georeferencing and coordinate system information
as well as selected other header metadata.<p>

If several Array objects are present in the label, they will be reported as
separate subdatasets.<p>

A mask band is attached to each source band. The
value of this mask band is 0 when the pixel value is one of the missing constants.<p>

Implementation of this driver was supported by the United States
Geological Survey.<p>

PDS4 is part of a family of related formats including PDS and ISIS3.<p>

<h2>Metadata</h2>

<p>The PDS4 label can be retrieved as XML-serialized
content in the xml:PDS4 metadata domain.</p>

<p>On creation, a source template label can be passed to the SetMetadata()
interface in the "xml:PDS4" metadata domain.</p>

<h2>Creation support</h2>

<p>The PDS4 driver supports updating imagery of
existing datasets, creating new datasets through the CreateCopy() and Create()
interfaces.</p>

<p>When using CreateCopy(), gdal_translate or gdalwarp, an effort is made to
preserve as much as possible of the original label when doing PDS4 to PDS4
conversions. This can be disabled with the USE_SRC_LABEL=NO creation option.
</p>

<p>The available creation options are:</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>IMAGE_FILENAME</b>=filename. Override default external image filename.</li>
<li> <b>IMAGE_EXTENSION</b>=ext. Override default extension of the external
image filename. The default is 'img' for IMAGE_FORMAT=RAW or 'tif' for
IMAGE_FORMAT=GEOTIFF</li>
<li> <b>IMAGE_FORMAT</b>=RAW/GEOTIFF. Format of the image file.
If using RAW, the imagery is put in a raw file whose filename is the main
filename with a .img extension. If using GEOTIFF, the imagery is put in a
separate GeoTIFF file, whose filename is the main filename with a .tif
extension. Defaults to RAW</li>
<li> <b>INTERLEAVE</b>=BSQ/BIP/BIL. Pixel organization in the image file.
BSQ is Band SeQuential, BIP is Band Interleaved per Pixel and BIL is Band
Interleave Per Line. The default is BSQ. BIL is not valid for
IMAGE_FORMAT=GEOTIFF</li>
<li> <b>VAR_*</b>=string. If options like VAR_XXXX=yyyy are specified, any
{XXXX} string in the template label will be replaced by the yyyy value.</li>
<li> <b>TEMPLATE</b>=filename. Template label to use. If not specified and
not creating from an existing PDS4 file, the data/pds4_template.xml file will
be used.</li>
<li> <b>USE_SRC_LABEL</b>=YES/NO. Whether to use the source label in PDS4 to
PDS4 conversions. Defaults to YES.</li>
<li> <b>LATITUDE_TYPE</b>=planetocentric/planetographic. Value of latitude_type.
Defaults to planetographic.</li>
<li> <b>LONGITUDE_DIRECTION</b>=Positive East/Positive West.
Value of longitude_direction. Defaults to Positive East.</li>
<li> <b>BOUNDING_DEGREES</b>=west_lon,south_lat,east_lon,north_lat. Manually set
bounding box</li>
</ul>
