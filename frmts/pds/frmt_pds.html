<h1>PDS -- Planetary Data System</h1>

PDS is a format used primarily by NASA to store and distribute 
solar, lunar and planetary imagery data.  GDAL provides read-only
access to PDS formatted imagery data.<p>

PDS files often have the extension .img, sometimes with an associated
.lbl (label) file.  When a .lbl file exists it should be used as
the dataset name rather than the .img file.<p>

In addition to support for most PDS imagery configurations, this
driver also reads georeferencing and coordinate system information
as well as selected other header metadata.<p>

Implementation of this driver was supported by the United States
Geological Survey.<p>

PDS is part of a family of related formats including ISIS2 and ISIS3.<p>
