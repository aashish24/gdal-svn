PROVENANCE
----------

This directory contains a *modified* version of - presumably - degrib 1.80 (given
the original subdirectory name degrib18)

https://sats.nws.noaa.gov/~degrib/release/degrib1.80.txt

The original 1.80 version is apparently no longer available on the web. The closest
one is degrib 1.81:
https://sats.nws.noaa.gov/~degrib/download/archive/degrib-20060831.tar.gz

The degrib-XXXX.tar.gz includes a bundled version of the g2clib library,
at version 1.0.4 in the case of degrib 1.80

This internal g2clib has also been modified for GDAL needs.
