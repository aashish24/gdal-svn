<h1>ECW -- ERDAS Compress Wavelets (.ecw)</h1>

GDAL supports .ecw format for read access and write.  The current 
implementation reads any number of bands but returns only as eight bit
image data.  Coordinate system and georeferencing transformations are read,
but in some cases coordinate systems may not translate.<p>

Support for the ECW driver in GDAL is optional, and requires linking
in external ECW SDK libraries provided by ERDAS.<p>

By default the ECW SDK will use up to one quarter of physical RAM for 
internal caching and work memory during decoding.  This is normally fine, 
but the amount of memory to use can be adjusted by setting the 
GDAL_ECW_CACHE_MAXMEM configuration variable with an amount of memory in 
bytes.  Config variables can be set in the environment or using the --config
commandline switch.<p>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

The ECW 4.x SDK from ERDAS is only free for image decompression.  To 
compress images it is necessary to build with the read/write SDK and to 
provide an OEM licensing key at runtime which may be purchased from ERDAS.<p>

For those still using the ECW 3.3 SDK, images less than 500MB may be 
compressed for free, while larger images require licensing from ERDAS.  See
the licensing agreement and the LARGE_OK option.<p>

Files to be compressed into ECW format must also
be at least 128x128.  Non-eight bit source data will be rescaled by
the ECW SDK in some manner that I don't understand ... the resulting image
is effectively eight bit.<p>

When writing coordinate system information to ECW files, many less
common coordinate systems are not mapped properly.  If you know the 
ECW name for the coordinate system you can force it to be set at
creation time with the PROJ and DATUM creation options. <p>

Creation Options:<p>

<ul>

<li> <b>TARGET=percent</b>: Set the target size reduction as a percentage of 
the original.  If not provided defaults to 75 for an 75% reduction.<p>

<li> <b>PROJ=name</b>: Name of the ECW projection string to use. 
Common examples are NUTM11, or GEODETIC.<p>

<li> <b>DATUM=name</b>: Name of the ECW datum string to use. 
Common examples are WGS84 or NAD83.<p>

<li> <b>LARGE_OK=YES</b>: When built with the ECW 3.x SDK this option can be 
set to allow compressing files larger than 500MB.  It is the users 
responsibility to ensure that the licensing requirments for large file 
compression are being adhered to.<p>

<li> <b>ECW_ENCODE_KEY=key</b>: Provide the OEM encoding key purchased from 
Erdas which permits encoding images.  The key is is approximately 129 hex 
digits long.  It may also be provided globally as a configuration option.<p>

<li> <b>ECW_ENCODE_COMPANY=name</b>: Provide the name of the company ERDAS
issued the OEM encoding key (see ECW_ENCODE_KEY) to.  This must exactly match
the name used by ERDAS in issuing the OEM key.  It may also be provided 
globally as a configuration option.<p>

</ul>

ECW format does not support creation of overviews since the ECW format 
is already considered to be optimized for "arbitrary overviews". <P>
