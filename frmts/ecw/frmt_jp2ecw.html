<h1>JP2ECW -- ERMapper JPEG2000 (.jp2)</h1>

GDAL supports reading and writing JPEG2000 files using the ECW SDK from 
ERMapper.<p>

Coordinate system and georeferencing transformations are read, and 
some degree of support is included for GeoJP2 (tm) (GeoTIFF-in-JPEG2000), 
ERMapper GML-in-JPEG2000, and the new GML-in-JPEG2000 specification developed
at OGC. <p>

Support for the JP2ECW driver in GDAL is optional, and requires linking
in external ECW SDK libraries provided by ERMapper.<p>

By default the ECW SDK will use up to one quarter of physical RAM for 
internal caching and work memory during decoding.  This is normally fine, 
but the amount of memory to use can be adjusted by setting the 
GDAL_ECW_CACHE_MAXMEM configuration variable with an amount of memory in 
bytes.  Config variables can be set in the environment or using the --config
commandline switch.<p>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

The free ECW compression kit only supports compression of images up to 
500MB.  To compress very large images it is necessary to license ECW
technology from ERMapper. Creation of 8 bit, and 16bit signed or unsigned
values is supported.<p>

Creation Options:<p>

<ul>

<li> <b>TARGET=percent</b>: Set the target size reduction as a percentage of 
the original.  If not provided defaults to 75 for an 75% reduction.<p>

<li> <b>PROJ=name</b>: Name of the ERMapper projection string to use. 
Common examples are NUTM11, or GEODETIC.<p>

<li> <b>DATUM=name</b>: Name of the ERMapper datum string to use. 
Common examples are WGS84 or NAD83.<p>

<li> <b>LARGE_OK=YES/NO</b>: Under some circumstances this option can be set
to allow compressing files larger than 500MB.  It is the users responsibility
to ensure that ERMapper licensing requirments for large file compression
are being adhered to.<p>

<li> <b>GMLJP2=YES/NO</b>: Indicates whether a GML box conforming to the OGC GML in JPEG2000 specification should be included in the file.  Defaults to YES.<p>

<li> <b>GeoJP2=YES/NO</b>: Indicates whether a GML box conforming to the GeoJP2 (GeoTIFF in JPEG2000) specification should be included in the file.  Defaults to YES.<p>

<li> <b>PROFILE=profile</b>: One of BASELINE_0, BASELINE_1, BASELINE_2, 
NPJE or EPJE.  Review the ECW SDK documentation for details on profile 
meanings.<p>

<li> <b>PROGRESSION=LRCP/RLCP/RPCL</b>: Set the progression order with
which the JPEG2000 codestream is written.<p>

<li> <b>CODESTREAM_ONLY=YES/NO</b>: If set to YES, only the compressed
imagery code stream will be written.  If NO (the default) a JP2 package
will be written around the code stream including a variety of meta
information.<p>

<li> <b>LEVELS=n</b>: See ECW SDK for details.<p>
<li> <b>LAYERS=n</b>: See ECW SDK for details.<p>
<li> <b>PRECINCT_WIDTH=n</b>: See ECW SDK for details.<p>
<li> <b>PRECINCT_HEIGHT=n</b>: See ECW SDK for details.<p>
<li> <b>TILE_WIDTH=n</b>: See ECW SDK for details.<p>
<li> <b>TILE_HEIGHT=n</b>: See ECW SDK for details.<p>
<li> <b>INCLUDE_SOP=YES/NO</b>: See ECW SDK for details.<p>
<li> <b>INCLUDE_EPH=YES/NO</b>: See ECW SDK for details.<p>
<li> <b>DECOMPRESS_LAYERS=n</b>: See ECW SDK for details.<p>
<li> <b>DECOMPRESS_RECONSTRUCTION_PARAMETER=n</b>: See ECW SDK for details.<p>

</ul>

JPEG2000 format does not support creation of overviews since the format 
is already considered to be optimized for "arbitrary overviews". <P>
