<h1>Leveller --- Daylon Leveller Heightfield</h1>

This driver implements read-only access to Leveller heightfields. 
Leveller heightfields store 32-bit elevation values with 
optional simple geospatial measures (but not positioning).
Format versions 4 through 6 are supported, which do not 
have full georeferencing. The file extension for Leveller heightfields is "TER" (which 
is the same as Terragen, but the driver only recognizes Leveller files).<p>

Although format versions 4 and 5 use 16.16 fixed-point storage,
the driver autoconverts them to floating-point so that GDAL 
always sees pixels of type Float32.<p>
