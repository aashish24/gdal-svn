<h1>MSGN -- Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Native Archive Format (.nat)</h1>

GDAL supports reading only of MSG native files. These files may have
nything from 1 to 12 bands, all at 10-bit resolution.<p>

Currently the driver ignores the 12th band (HRV) because it does not have
the same resolution as the others, so it can not be accommodated within the
same dataset. Adding support for this band would be straightforward, though.<p>

Georeferencing is currently supported, but the results may not be
acceptable, depending on your requirements. The current workaround is to
implement the CGMS Geostationary projection directly.<p>
