<h1>Terragen --- Terragen&trade; Terrain File</h1>

Terragen terrain files store 16-bit elevation values with 
optional gridspacing (but not positioning).
The file extension for Terragen heightfields is "TER" or "TERRAIN" (which 
in the former case is the same as Leveller, but the driver only recognizes Terragen files). The driver ID is "Terragen".
The dataset is file-based and has only one elevation band.
Void elevations are not supported. Pixels are considered points.
<p>

<h2>Reading</h2>
<blockquote>
dataset::GetProjectionRef() returns a local coordinate system 
using meters.
<p>
band::GetUnitType() returns meters.
<p>
Elevations are Int16. You must use the band::GetScale() and 
band::GetOffset() to convert them to meters.
<p>&nbsp;<br>
</blockquote>

<h2>Writing</h2>
<blockquote>
Use the Create call. Set the MINUSERPIXELVALUE option (a float) 
to the lowest elevation of your elevation data, and 
MAXUSERPIXELVALUE to the highest. The units must match 
the elevation units you will give to band::SetUnitType().
<p>
Call dataset::SetProjection() and dataset::SetGeoTransform()
with your coordinate system details. Otherwise, the driver 
will not encode physical elevations properly. Geographic 
(degree-based) coordinate systems will be converted to 
a local meter-based system.
<p>
Elevations are Float32.
<p>&nbsp;<br>
</blockquote>


<h2>Roundtripping</h2>
<blockquote>
Errors per trip tend to be a few centimeters for elevations 
and up to one or two meters for ground extents if 
degree-based coordinate systems are written. Large degree-based 
DEMs incur unavoidable distortions since the driver currently 
only uses meters.
