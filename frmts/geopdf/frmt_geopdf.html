<h1>GeoPDF</h1>

(Available for GDAL >= 1.8.0)
<p>
GDAL supports reading GeoPDF documents, by extracting georeferencing information and rasterizing the data. Non-geographic
PDF documents will also be recognized by the driver.
<p>
GDAL must be compiled with libpoppler support, and libpoppler itself must have been configured with
--enable-xpdf-headers so that the xpdf C++ headers are available.
<p>
The driver supports reading georeferencing encoded in either of the 2 current existing ways : the OGC
GeoPDF encoding best practice (promoted by TerraGo), or according to the Adobe Supplement to ISO 32000.
<p>
The dimensions of the raster can be controlled by specifying the DPI of the rasterization with the
<i>GDAL_GEOPDF_DPI</i> configuration option. Its default value is 150.
<p>
Multipage documents are exposed as subdatasets, one subdataset par page of the document.
<p>
The neatline will be reported as a NEATLINE metadata item, so that it can be later used as a cutline
for the warping algorithm.
<p>

<h2>Restrictions</h2>

The opening of a PDF document (to get the georeferencing) is fast, but at the first access to a raster block,
the whole page will be rasterized, which can be a slow operation.
<p>
Only a few of the possible Datums available in the GeoPDF (OGC best practice) spec have been currently mapped
in the driver. Unrecognized datums will be considered as being based on the WGS84 ellipsoid.
<p>
For GeoPDF (OGC best practice) documents that contain several NeatLines in a page (insets), the georeferencing will be
extracted from the inset that has the largest area (in term of screen points).
<p>
There is currently no support for selective layer rendering.
