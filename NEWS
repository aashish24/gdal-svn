   supporting "minixml" support to CPL.			

 o PostGIS: Upgraded to PostGIS 0.6.  Added "soft transaction" semantics.  
   Many create feature calls can now be part of one transaction.  Transactions
   are now a general OGR concept although only implemented for PostGIS. 

 o Added transform() and transformTo() methods for reprojecting geometries and
   added user options for this in ogr2ogr.

 o Very preliminary GML read/write support.  Needs Xerces C++ XML parser for
   read support.

- Added support for attribute queries by parsing out WHERE clause.
- In general substantial rework and extentions were made to make it
work with ESRI and AutoDesk clients.

o Added gdal/data/stateplane.txt - a test file with one line per state plane
zone for applications wanting to present options to users.

o Install ogrsf_frmts.a on install if building with OGR support enabled.

o Reports layer extents in ogrinfo.
