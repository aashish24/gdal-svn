\section osgeo OSGeo Project Membership

Traditionally GDAL has been lead by Frank Warmerdam, the original author of
much of GDAL/OGR, though with contributions and input from a variety of people. 
As of February 2006 GDAL/OGR became a founding project of the 
<a href="http://www.osgeo.org/">Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)</a> 
and began a transition to a more community oriented governance model - in keeping
with OSGeo expectations. 

Membership as an OSGeo project provides assurances that a variety of best practices
are being employed by the GDAL/OGR project, and that users and contributors can
be assured of responsible project operation and continuity of the project.   In
particular:

<ul>

<li> A consensus oriented Project Management Committee will be in charge of the project.
<li> Project source code and contributions will be vetted to ensure code is properly
made available, protecting contributors and users of GDAL/OGR. 

<li> Systems infrastructure is provided by the foundation, with responsible backup and
redundancy to minimize disruptions. 

</ul>

\section pmc Project Management Committee

As of April 2006 (following the GDAL/OGR 1.3.2 release) the project has been 
placed in the hands of a Project Steering Committee consisting of Frank Warmerdam,
Andrey Kiselev, Daniel Morissette and Howard Butler.  This project steering 
committee operates under the rules of \link rfc1_pmc.html GDAL/OGR RFC 1\endlink. 

Note that discussion of proposals to the PMC take place on gdal-dev, and input
from all subscribers is welcome.  A \link rfc_list list of past RFCs\endlink, 
and \link psc_motions past motions \endlink is available for review.
