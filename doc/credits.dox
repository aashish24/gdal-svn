\page credits Sponsors, Acknowledgements and Credits

There are too many people who have helped since GDAL/OGR was launched in 
late 1998 for me to thank them all.  I have received moral support, 
financial support, code contributions, sample datasets, and bug reports
from literally hundreds of people.  However, below I would like to single
out a few people and organizations who have supported GDAL over the 
years.  Forgive me for all those I left out.<p>
