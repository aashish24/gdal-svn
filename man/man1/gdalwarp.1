.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The gdalwarp utility is a simple image reprojection and warping utility. The program can reproject to any support projection, and can also apply GCPs stored with the image if the image is 'raw' with control information.
.PP
.IP "\fB\fB-s_srs\fP \fIsrs def\fP:\fP" 1c
source spatial reference set. The coordinate systems that can be passed are anything supported by the OGRSpatialReference.SetFromUserInput() call, which includes EPSG PCS and GCSes (ie. EPSG:4296), PROJ.4 declarations (as above), or the name of a .prf file containing well known text. 
.IP "\fB\fB-t_srs\fP \fIsrs_def\fP:\fP" 1c
target spatial reference set. The coordinate systems that can be passed are anything supported by the OGRSpatialReference.SetFromUserInput() call, which includes EPSG PCS and GCSes (ie. EPSG:4296), PROJ.4 declarations (as above), or the name of a .prf file containing well known text. 
.IP "\fB\fB-order\fP \fIn\fP:\fP" 1c
order of polynomial used for warping (1 to 3). The default is to select a polynomial order based on the number of GCPs. 
.IP "\fB\fB-tps\fP\fP" 1c
Enable use of thin plate spline transformer based on available GCPs. Use this \fIinstead\fP of the -order switch. 
.IP "\fB\fB-et\fP \fIerr_threshold\fP:\fP" 1c
error threshold for transformation approximation (in pixel units - defaults to 0.125). 
.IP "\fB\fB-te\fP \fIxmin ymin xmax ymax\fP:\fP" 1c
set georeferenced extents of output file to be created. 
.IP "\fB\fB-tr\fP \fIxres yres\fP:\fP" 1c
set output file resolution (in target georeferenced units) 
.IP "\fB\fB-ts\fP \fIwidth height\fP:\fP" 1c
set output file size in pixels and lines 
.IP "\fB\fB-wo\fP \fI'NAME=VALUE'\fP:\fP" 1c
Set a warp options. The GDALWarpOptions::papszWarpOptions docs show all options. Multiple \fB-wo\fP options may be listed. 
.IP "\fB\fB-ot\fP \fItype\fP:\fP" 1c
For the output bands to be of the indicated data type. 
.IP "\fB\fB-wt\fP \fItype\fP:\fP" 1c
Working pixel data type. The data type of pixels in the source image and destination image buffers. 
.IP "\fB\fB-rn\fP:\fP" 1c
Use nearest neighbour resampling (default, fastest algorithm, worst interpolation quality). 
.IP "\fB\fB-rb\fP:\fP" 1c
Use bilinear resampling. 
.IP "\fB\fB-rc\fP:\fP" 1c
Use cubic resampling. 
.IP "\fB\fB-rcs\fP:\fP" 1c
Use cubic spline resampling (slowest algorithm). 
.IP "\fB\fB-srcnodata\fP \fIvalue [value...]\fP:\fP" 1c
Set nodata masking values for input bands (different values can be supplied for each band). If more than one value is supplied all values should be quoted to keep them together as a single operating system argument. Masked values will not be used in interpolation. 
.IP "\fB\fB-dstnodata\fP \fIvalue [value...]\fP:\fP" 1c
Set nodata values for output bands (different values can be supplied for each band). If more than one value is supplied all values should be quoted to keep them together as a single operating system argument. New files will be initialized to this value and if possible the nodata value will be recorded in the output file. 
.IP "\fB\fB-wm\fP \fImemory_in_mb\fP:\fP" 1c
Set the amount of memory (in megabytes) that the warp API is allowed to use for caching. 
.IP "\fB\fB-multi\fP:\fP" 1c
Use multithreaded warping implementation. Multiple threads will be used to process chunks of image and perform input/output operation simultaneously. 
.IP "\fB\fB-q\fP:\fP" 1c
Be quiet. 
.IP "\fB\fB-of\fP \fIformat\fP:\fP" 1c
Select the output format. The default is GeoTIFF (GTiff). Use the short format name.  
.IP "\fB\fB-co\fP \fI'NAME=VALUE'\fP:\fP" 1c
passes a creation option to the output format driver. Multiple \fB-co\fP options may be listed. See format specific documentation for legal creation options for each format.  
.IP "\fB\fIsrcfile\fP:\fP" 1c
The source file name.  
.IP "\fB\fIdstfile\fP:\fP" 1c
The destination file name.  
.PP
.PP
Mosaicing into an existing output file is supported if the output file already exists.

For instance, an eight bit spot scene stored in GeoTIFF with control points mapping the corners to lat/long could be warped to a UTM projection with a command like this:

.nf

gdalwarp -t_srs '+proj=utm +zone=11 +datum=WGS84' raw_spot.tif utm11.tif

For instance, the second channel of an ASTER image stored in HDF with control points mapping the corners to lat/long could be warped to a UTM projection with a command like this:
