    * commandline options:
    * <p><ul>
    *  <li>--version: report version of GDAL in use.
    *  <li>--license: report GDAL license info.
    *  <li>--formats: report all format drivers configured.

    *  <li>--optfile filename: expand an option file into the argument list. 
    *  <li>--config key value: set system configuration option. 
    *  <li>--debug [on/off/value]: set debug level.
    *  <li>--mempreload dir: preload directory contents into /vsimem

 * regions of fairly continuously varying rasters (such as elevation
 * models for instance).  It is also suitable for filling small holes
 * and cracks in more irregularly varying images (like airphotos).  It
 * is generally not so great for interpolating a raster from sparse 
 * point data - see the algorithms defined in gdal_grid.h for that case.

/** 
 * Removes small raster polygons. 
 *
 * The function removes raster polygons smaller than a provided
 * threshold size (in pixels) and replaces replaces them with the pixel value 
 * of the largest neighbour polygon.  
 * <p>
 * Polygon are determined (per GDALRasterPolygonEnumerator) as regions of
 * the raster where the pixels all have the same value, and that are contiguous
 * (connected).  
 * <p>
 * Pixels determined to be "nodata" per maskBand will not be treated as part
 * of a polygon regardless of their pixel values.  Nodata areas will never be
 * changed nor affect polygon sizes. 
 * <p>
 * Polygons smaller than the threshold with no neighbours that are as large
 * as the threshold will not be altered.  Polygons surrounded by nodata areas
 * will therefore not be altered.  
 * <p>
 * The algorithm makes three passes over the input file to enumerate the
 * polygons and collect limited information about them.  Memory use is 
 * proportional to the number of polygons (roughly 24 bytes per polygon), but
 * is not directly related to the size of the raster.  So very large raster
 * files can be processed effectively if there aren't too many polygons.  But
 * extremely noisy rasters with many one pixel polygons will end up being 
 * expensive (in memory) to process.
 * 
 * @param srcBand the source raster band to be processed.
 * @param maskBand an optional mask band.  All pixels in the mask band with a 
 * value other than zero will be considered suitable for inclusion in polygons.
 * @param dstBand the output raster band.  It may be the same as srcBand
 * to update the source in place. 
 * @param threshold raster polygons with sizes smaller than this will
 * be merged into their largest neighbour.
 * @param connectedness either 4 indicating that diagonal pixels are not
 * considered directly adjacent for polygon membership purposes or 8
 * indicating they are. 
 * @param options algorithm options in name=value list form.  None currently
 * supported. just pass null
 * @param callback for reporting progress or null
 * 
 * @return gdalconst.CE_None on success or gdalconst.CE_Failure on a failure.
