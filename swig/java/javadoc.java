    * commandline options:
    * <p><ul>
    *  <li>--version: report version of GDAL in use.
    *  <li>--license: report GDAL license info.
    *  <li>--formats: report all format drivers configured.
    *  <li>--format [format]: report details of one format driver. 
    *  <li>--optfile filename: expand an option file into the argument list. 
    *  <li>--config key value: set system configuration option. 
    *  <li>--debug [on/off/value]: set debug level.
    *  <li>--mempreload dir: preload directory contents into /vsimem
    *  <li>--help-general: report detailed help on general options. 
    * </ul><p>

 * Fetch the "natural" block size of this band.
 *
 * GDAL contains a concept of the natural block size of rasters so that
 * applications can organized data access efficiently for some file formats.
 * The natural block size is the block size that is most efficient for
 * accessing the format.  For many formats this is simple a whole scanline
 * in which case pnBlockXSize[0] is set to GetXSize(), and pnBlockXSize[1] is set to 1.
 * <p>
 * However, for tiled images this will typically be the tile size.
 * <p>
 * Note that the X and Y block sizes don't have to divide the image size
 * evenly, meaning that right and bottom edge blocks may be incomplete.
 * See <a href="#ReadBlock_Direct(int, int, java.nio.ByteBuffer)">ReadBlock_Direct()</a> for an example of code dealing with these issues.
