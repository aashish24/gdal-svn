This file lists the backwards incompatible changes in the Perl
bindings API in version 2.0.

There are numerous other changes but they are meant to be
non-breaking.

To be on the safe side, new code should be written according to
what is presented in the documentation.

class Geo::GDAL::GCP:

    attributes GCP* are renamed as * (the prefix GCP is removed)

many classes:

    Class attributes (arrays or hashes with upcase names) may have
    been (re)moved, accessor functions which return lists, like
    GeometryTypes(), are the replacement.

Geo::OSR::SpatialReference:

    Overloading to "", and = have been removed. Use explicit 
    method call As('PrettyWKT') instead.

Geo::OGR::Layer

    Tuple requires now the geometry fields as last.

Geo::OGR::Feature

    Tuple requires now the geometry fields as last.

Geo::OSR

    Projection and other constants (strings) are now mixed case, as
    the values in GDAL.
