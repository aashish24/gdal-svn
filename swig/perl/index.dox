\section index_version Version

These pages document the forthcoming version 1.5 API, which is still
under construction. The documentation for the version 1.4 is available
<a href="http://map.hut.fi/doc/Geo-GDAL-1.4/html/index.html">here</a>.

\section index_intro Introduction

The Geo::GDAL modules are the Perl bindings to the GDAL/OGR
library. The modules allow you to access and manipulate from Perl all
geospatial data that the installed GDAL library is configured to
read/write.

This documentation covers mainly the syntax of the bindings. For more
in-depth documentation see the main documentation of <a
href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL</a> and <a
href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr/">OGR</a>.

Some arguments are optional and have a default value. This is
illustrated like this:

SomeMethod(arg1, arg2 = 4);

arg1 is a required argument and an example or a variable with
illustrative name is given

arg2 is optional and if left off, will get the value 4 (in this case)

This documentation reflects the version in the GDAL SVN at
https://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/gdal
