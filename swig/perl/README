Geo-GDAL
=======================

This is the swig-generated Perl interface to the GDAL/OGR library, the
same one which is distributed with GDAL. GDAL is available from
www.gdal.org.

You need to have the development (header files etc.) versions of gdal and
geos libraries available in your system to build these modules.

This module is _not_ compatible with Geo::GDAL 0.11

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL

You may need to edit the Makefile.PL to add the path to the GEOS
DLL's.
