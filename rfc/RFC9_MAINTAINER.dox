\page rfc9_maintainer RFC 9: GDAL Paid Maintainer Guidelines

Author: Frank Warmerdam<br>
Contact: warmerdam@pobox.com<br>
Status: Approved<br>

\section rfc9_purpose Purpose

To formalize guidelines for the work of maintainers paid out of GDAL project
sponsorship funds.

\section rfc9_responsibilities Responsibilities

<ol>
<li> Analyse and where possible fix bugs reported against GDAL.
<li> Run, review and extend the test suite (via buildbot, etc). 
<li> Maintain and extend documentation.
<li> Assist integrating new contributed features.
<li> Help maintain project infrastructure (mailing lists, buildbot, source 
control, etc)
<li> Provide user support on the project mailing lists, and in other venues.
<li> Develop new capabilities.
</ol>

Bug fixing and maintenance should be focused on GDAL/OGR, but as
needed will extend into sub-projects such as libtiff, libgeotiff, Shapelib and
MITAB as long it is to serve a need of the GDAL/OGR project.

In order to provide reasonable response times the maintainer is expected spend
some time each week addressing new bugs and user support.  If the maintainer
will be unavailable for an extended period of time (vacation, etc) then 
the supervisor should be notified.

\section rfc9_direction Direction

The maintainer is generally subject to the project PSC.  However, for day 
to day decisions one PSC member will be designated as the supervisor for
the maintainer.  This supervisor will prioritize work via email, bug 
assignments, and IRC discussions.

The supervisor will try to keep the following in mind when prioritizing tasks.

<ul>
<li> Bug reports, and support needs of Sponsors should be given higher 
priority than other tasks. 
<li> Areas of focus identified by the PSC (ie. multi-threading, SWIG scripting)
should be given higher priority than other tasks.
<li> Bugs or needs that affect many users should have higher priority.
<li> The maintainer should be used to take care of work that no one else
is willing and able to do (ie. fill the holes, rather than displacing 
volunteers)
<li> Try to avoid tieing up the maintainer on one big task for many weeks
unless directed by the PSC.  
<li> The maintainer should not be directed to do work for which someone else
is getting paid. 
</ul>

Substantial new development projects will only be taken on by the maintainer
with the direction of a PSC motion (or possibly an RFC designating the 
maintainer to work on a change).

Note that the maintainer and the maintainer supervisor are subject to the
normal RFC process for any substantial change to GDAL. 

\section rfc9_reporting Reporting

The maintainer will produce a brief bi-weekly report to the gdal-dev list 
indicating tasks worked on, and a more detailed timesheet for the supervisor.

This is intended to provide visibility into status, accomplishments, and
time allocation.  It also gives an opportunity for the PSC to request a
"course correction" fairly promptly.
