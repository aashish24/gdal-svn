\page rfc2_svn RFC 2: Migration to OSGeo Subversion Repository

Author: Frank Warmerdam<br>
Contact: warmerdam@pobox.com<br>
Status: Adopted (implementation delayed)<br>

\section summary Summary

It is proposed that the GDAL source tree be moved a subversion repository
in such a manner as to preserve the history existing in the CVS repository.
A 1.3.x branch will be created after automatic updating of the header format.

\section details Details

<ol>
<li> The conversion will be done by Howard Butler using the cvs2svn tool. 

<li> At least 24 hours notice will be provided before the transition starts to 
allow committers to commit any outstanding work that is ready to into the
repository.

<li> When the conversion starts, the GDAL (and gdalautotest) trees will be
removed from cvs.maptools.org, and archived to avoid any confusion. 

<li> Frank Warmerdam will modify the "daily cvs snapshot" capability to work from SVN.

<li> Frank will be responsible for updating the source control 
information in the documentation. 

<li> All source files in SVN will have the svn:keywords property set to "Id"
by Frank after they are created. 

<li> Committers will need to get a login on osgeo.org and notify Frank to
regain commit access.  Committer access on the new repository will be enabled
after the above changes are all complete. 

<li> The GDAL committers document should be updated, removing non-GDAL 
commiters (ie. libtiff, geotiff, etc).

</ol>

\section header Header Format

SVN does not support history insertion in source files, and to keep the
old history listings around without keeping them up to date would be very
confusing.  So it is proposed that Frank Warmerdam write a script to strip
the history logs out.  Changing this:

\verbatim
/******************************************************************************
 * $Id$
 *
 * Project:  GDAL Core
 * Purpose:  Color table implementation.
 * Author:   Frank Warmerdam, warmerdam@pobox.com

 * minor formatting fix
 */

#include "gdal_priv.h"

CPL_CVSID("$Id$");
\endverbatim

to this:

\verbatim
/******************************************************************************
 * $Id$
 *
 * Project:  GDAL Core
 * Purpose:  Color table implementation.
 * Author:   Frank Warmerdam, warmerdam@pobox.com

#include "gdal_priv.h"

CPL_CVSID("$Id$");
\endverbatim

\section branch Branch for 1.3

Once the headers have been updated appropriately, a 1.3 branch will be
established in subversion.  The intent is that further 1.3.x releases would
be made against this "stable branch" while trunk work is towards a 1.4.0 
release targetted for around the time of the OSGeo conference.
